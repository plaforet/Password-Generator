# Password-Generator
A little applet that can generate random passwords of a given length.

## Intro
I wanted to try my hand at applets, so I made this password generator. This project is modeled after the Password Generator tool built into the Dashlane Password Manager software. Here is a screenshot of Dashlane's tool:

I relied heavily on [Oracle's Java tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/index.html "Oracle Java Tutorials: Using Swing Components"), as well as reverse engineering their sample code for sliders, text fields, etc., so if there's room for improvement as far as formatting, etc., please let me know.

## TODO
I'd like to include combo boxes to toggle the inclusion of digits, letters, and symbols, similar to Dashlane's tool. If I want to have the combo boxes on the same line, I think I'll need to change the layout type of the applet (it's currently a BoxLayout), but I'm not sure. I'll do some more research.
