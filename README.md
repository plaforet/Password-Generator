# Password-Generator
A little applet that can generate random passwords of a given length.

## Intro
I wanted to try my hand at applets, so I made this password generator. I relied heavily on [Oracle's Java tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/index.html "Oracle Java Tutorials: Using Swing Components"), so if there's room for improvement as far as formatting, etc., please let me know.
